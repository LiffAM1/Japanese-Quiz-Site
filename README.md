# JCE Quiz Site #
https://jce-quizzes.com

I created this site to get experience with Google Cloud Platform and to study for Japanese class. The site allows you to take quizzes in the various Japanese alphabets (currently I only have Romanji and Hiragana set up but will add Katakana soon).

Stack:
- Python 3.12
- Flask
- A bit of janky Javascript/JQuery
- HTML templates rendered with Jinja2
- GCP Firestore
- GCP App Engine Standard
- GCP Secret Manager
